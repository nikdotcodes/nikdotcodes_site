    <p class="lead">What I'm doing to write an OSE campaign</p>
    <p>So, I have a weekly TTRPG group in the next town along where we do stints of 12<em>(ish)</em> weeks of whatever game people want to play. We’ve had a bit of everything;</p>

<ul>
  <li>D&amp;D</li>
  <li>Pathfinder</li>
  <li>Shadowrun</li>
  <li>Traveller</li>
  <li>Mork Borg</li>
  <li>Troika</li>
  <li>The list goes on…</li>
</ul>

<p>Now the next rounds of games isn’t until January time, which gives me a great opportunity to do what I’ve been wanting to do for a while</p>

<p><strong>Run my own OSE campaign!</strong></p>

<p>I’ve ran a few games now (mainly Mork Borg &amp; Troika) but these were simply adventures that I’ve obtained over time with not much in between; which was fun and all, but I don’t feel really scratched that itch that I have deep down. So before the next series of games, I’ve decided to come up with a campaign setting, and I plan on using OSE to run it.</p>

<h1 id="what-the-hell-is-ose">What the hell is OSE</h1>

<p><a href="https://necroticgnome.com/">OSE (or Old School Essentials)</a> is a tidy up of the Basic &amp; Expert Editions of Dungeons &amp; Dragons (B/X) from back when in the 80’s. It’s a step away from the “Powerful to Superhero quest to save the land” that 5<sup>th</sup> edition has led to and is more of “Layman to Stronger &amp; Richer Layman”; one of the key features of these older style games is an emphasis on the world over the party.</p>

<p>Last year I backed a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/exaltedfuneral/old-school-essentials-fantasy-rpg-box-sets">Kickstarter from Exhaulted Funeral</a> and I got so many wonderful books earlier this year, and it’s just been sitting on my shelf gathering dust.</p>

  </figure>

<p>Alongside this, I have amassed a number of different adventures, modules, and other bits and pieces into a nice collection.</p>

<h1 id="so-what-do-you-need-to-do">So what do you need to do?</h1>

<p>If I’ve got all of this stuff, then what actual work do I need to put in?</p>

<p>As I mentioned, there is importance in the world. General idea is to drop the party in a location, and let them decide where to go. As the GM, it’s my job to build a satisfying world with enough life and intrigue to keep the players wanting to play. These can be…</p>

<ul>
  <li>Locations (Map, Towns, Cities, Places of Interest, etc…)</li>
  <li>Factions (Countries/Fiefdoms, Religions, Guilds, etc…)</li>
  <li>History &amp; Lore</li>
</ul>

<p>What I am aiming for is creating a world where, in a 12 week period, a party can play their own adventure - the world can change (alliances can change, powers grow or wane, etc…) - but there’s nothing stopping or impeding another party from being able to have their own adventure in another corner of the world.</p>

<h1 id="sounds-like-a-lot-of-work">Sounds like a lot of work</h1>

<p>And in a relatively short amount of time too. Thankfully, for a game to start, we don’t need the whole map planned out fully. Just like many video games out there, we have a starting location with limited access to the wider world out there.</p>

<p>And there’s many tools out there to help, in particular I’ll be starting with <a href="https://ia802600.us.archive.org/7/items/the-gygax-75-challenge-ttrpg-worldbuilding-resource/gygax75v3.2.pdf">the Gygax 75 Challenge</a>. This 5 week process was recommended by many of the internets and is a nice framework to getting started. Then I can start slipping in elements from my module &amp; adventure collection, and building out the world more and more.</p>

<p>Or at least that’s the plan anyway.</p>

<p>So that’s the plan, every week I’ll post up the results of that week’s work according to the book &amp; hopefully by the start of December, I should have a nicely populated world, ready for adventuring in!.</p>

<p>Until next time!</p>
