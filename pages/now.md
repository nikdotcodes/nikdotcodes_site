# /Now
## 24<sup>th</sup> March 2024

- Masters still going, nearly finished the first module.
- Working my way through a reading challenge, currently on my 5<sup>th</sup> book of 15 that I want to get through this year.
- Due to illness and injury, haven't ran or played TTRPGs for a long while, getting the itch...
- Following on from a couple of books I've read, my _"prepare for the inevitable failure of the state_ mentality has been shifted into a more positive light - blog post to follow (I promise!).
- Kids and partner are happy and healthy, albeit very tired and looking forward to the end of the school term.
