# /Now
## 21<sup>th</sup> December 2023

- Got accepted to the MEng in Data Engineering - Edinburgh Napier here I come (remotely!)
- Christmas is coming - currently typing this up whilst sitting in the dark on the upstairs landing whilst the second born is trying to sleep at a family member's. Such a strange new place for her.
- Still waiting on those SQL Bits volunteering details...
- I'm now on [BlueSky](https://bsky.app/profile/nik.codes) - although yet to post.
- The data warehousing NHS group is now live and kicking with a Slack channel and whatnot, finally a collaborative environment for this kind of thing in the NHS.s
