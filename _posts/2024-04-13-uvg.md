I can't exactly remember when I came across [Ultraviolet Grasslands](https://wizardthieffighter.itch.io/uvg-2e), it must have been around the time I was waiting for the Old School Essentials kickstarter to get to me. 

Look at it though, so beautiful.

All those colours really called to me, and I really _really_ had to get [the bundle](https://www.exaltedfuneral.com/products/uvg-2e-bundle) with GM Screen and **just under 6ft tall map!**

# So what is the book

So, the UVG2e book is a setting first, with the initial sprinkling of mechanics and rules added in. The overall world is known as the Rainbowlands, which centres around the Circle Sea. The book takes us from the Violet City located at the west of the sea through many-upon-many locales and sights to the far outreaches of the Black City, the remains of the 'Old Lands', where bizarre and miraculous beings and objects exist.

What we have is essentially a psychedelic sci-fi point crawl between all of these places of interest, and a hell of a lot of extra tidbits and tables to _**really**_ flesh out the carved out slither of this world.

- Vehicles and Mounts to get you and your caravan to your goal? _Check_
- A bestiary of weird creatures? _Check_
- Reams and reams of tables to help generate the history, society, geography, flora and fauna of this place? _Super Check_

# And that's not all

Cast your mind back to the previous section, there's 2 points that I'd like to flag...

1. UVG2e is majority setting, light on mechanics.
2. UVG2e is a slither of the Rainbowlands.
