I can't exactly remember when I came across [Ultraviolet Grasslands](https://wizardthieffighter.itch.io/uvg-2e), it must have been around the time I was waiting for the Old School Essentials kickstarter to get to me. 

Look at it though, so beautiful.

All those colours really called to me, and I really _really_ had to get [the bundle](https://www.exaltedfuneral.com/products/uvg-2e-bundle) with GM Screen and **just under 6ft tall map!**

## So what is the book

So, the UVG2e book is a setting first, with the initial sprinkling of mechanics and rules added in. The Rainbowlands centres around the Circle Sea, and the book takes us from the Violet City located at the west of the sea through many upon many locales and sights to the outreaches of the any semblance of a society at the Black City, the remains of the 'Old Lands', with bizarre and miraculous beings and objects exist.
